# FX-Futures-Price-Quoting

This is a python solution of my course assignment on FX Futures price quoting. The original work was done in Excel.

## Project Scenario
SGX is launching a new currency pairs for their FX Futures suite
The Contract Specifications are to follow the existing USD/SGD (mini) Futures Contract.		
You are working for a Market Maker, which is to quote Futures prices, based off the Spot Prices in the OTC Market.		
Quoting Criteria: 5 ticks wide, quoting Neutral.
For this exercise, treat for week-ends but ignore Banking Holidays (in the real-world, Banking Holidays are not good value dates)		
	
## Test cases
Test cases can be added in the input file.
